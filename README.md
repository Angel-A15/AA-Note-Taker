# Note Taker

## Project
My client is a small business owner that has trouble organizing their thoughts and keeping track of tasks. 
They request if I could make an application that allows them to write and save notes to help with their issue.

The clients criteria follow:

    * A landing page with a link to geting starting displays when app is deployed

    * Existing notes are in a left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

    * Save icon appears after filling new note title and text and saves note when clicked 

    * Clicking on existing notes on teh left-hand column will appear on the right-hand column

    * Write icon found in the navigation will present with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

## Description
To meet my clients requests, I constructed a codebase with the following:

    * HTML routes that return files such as; note.html and index.html

    * API routes that recieve, add, read, and return data to files and return all saved notes as JSON

    * Gave each new note a unique id when saved
    
    *
